				<p>There are three kinds of things that use standby power.
				Devices in standby. When you grab your TV's remote control and press ON, the TV has to be getting a little juice already so it can receive that ON signal and respond to it. It's "standing by" waiting for you to turn it on with the remote.</p>

				<p>Plug-in adapters. These are the big black blocks that convert AC to DC. Some of them draw some electric even when the device they're powering is turned off (or in the case of chargers, even when the phone or device is fully charged).</p>

				<p>Other devices that run off DC internally. In some devices the AC-to-DC adapter is internal, to avoid having the big, bulky plug-in adapter.</p>

					<p>Base buildings, barracks, training structures, and other buildings generally use forced-air for heating and cooling. Improved Environmental Control Units (IECUs) are units which provided cooling and heating in tactical operations, and function similar to the forced-air systems in base buildings.</p>

				<p>The two big problems that effect energy usage are blockage of airflow by blocking the registers and prolonged opened windows and doors. The system can't sense a register is closed, a door or window is opened - it will continue working at the same pace. In addition, the air from opened windows and doors can escape into the rest of the building, reducing the effectiveness of all your insulating and weathering. Changes in one areas of the building can affect another area. If air flow changes are required, report it to your supervisor.</p>

				<p>DO NOT close vent registers in unused rooms!</p>

					<p>DO NOT open windows or prop doors open!</p>

						<p>DO NOT cover air intakes or registers!</p>

					<p>Utilize natural lighting whenever possible. When feasible, turn off lights near windows. Use task lighting; instead of over lighting an entire room, focus the light where you need it, to directly illuminate work areas. Ensure that all exterior lights are turned off during the day. Turn off lights in offices and common areas during off-duty hours or when not needed. If you will be out of a room for 15 minutes or less, leave it on. If you will be out of a room for more than 15 minutes, turn it off.</p>
