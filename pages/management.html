				<p>Operation Dynamo is a phased project to emplace Advanced Medium Mobile Power Sources, known as AMMPS, Improved Environmental Control Units, or IECUs, and Power Distribution Illumination Systems, or PDISEs, at selected sites in the Combined Joint Operations Area - Afghanistan.</p>
				<p>The focus is on remote locations and other locations selected by U.S. Forces Afghanistan. PM MEP anticipates a reduced reliance on spot power generation and using between 40 to 60 percent less fuel once the equipment has been emplaced and units trained to operate and maintain it.</p>
