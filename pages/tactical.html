			<p>To demonstrate the benefits of reducing energy demand through better planning and materials, the 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) submitted an Operational Needs Statement (ONS) to request PM MEP assist with their set-up and equipment needs in Afghanistan; this support was named Operation Dynamo.</p>

			<p>During phase one, eight COPs were chosen to be assessed, upgraded & trained with the latest Environmental Control Units (ECUs), power generating and distribution equipment Power Distribution Illumination System Equipment (PDISE).</p>

			<p>The BCT OE Advisor and/or one of four OE Solutions teams traveled to remote COPs and Village Stability Platforms in the Combined Joint Operations Area to assess the conditions, engineer changes, and execute the plans to produce more reliable and efficient electrical power. These changes affected systems supporting life support, command post and sensors on the COP â€“ anything that depends on power. Power improvements are a combat multiplier.</p>

				<p>Energy distribution plays a dual role in combat effectiveness, it can enable commanders to do more, but it can also tie up resources such as fuel, equipment, and Soldiers to keep powering battle command equipment. PDISE is one solution in providing extended range and freedom of action. By utilizing PDISE you will be able to maximize tactical electrical power usage by maximizing load balancing, reducing the number of generators needed, improving their efficiency and reducing fuel usage.</p>

		<h3>Planning Process</h3>
		<div class="expand">
			<div class="expand-title">
			Site Layout
		</div>
			<div class="expand-content">
				<div class="expand-text">
					<p>Survey and develop site layout phase requires you to survey the location selected for occupation. It is linked to mission objectives, the commander's intent, and results in a strategy or scheme that is approved by the commander.</p>

					<p>As the Tactical Electric Power Planner you should address the following key points with unit staff when planning the site layout</p>

			<li>Consider distances and locations from loads to power source. (cables and vehicle traffic, terrain such as water, natural or manmade obstacles)</li>

			<li>Fueling, access to fuel storage, refueling operations. (distance to fuel point, safety considerations, environmental considerations)</li>

			<li>Noise control, location of operation area. (proximity of work areas, sleep areas, DFAC/mobile kitchen [MKT])</li>

			<li>Availability/Readiness of modified table of organization & equipment (MTOE) equipment and power requirements.</li>

			<p>Before emplacing the PDISE, the power plant must be located where the PDISE system components can reach all areas of the CB.</p>

			<p>Cables used to transfer power between the generator sets, PDISE systems, and load devices are subject to voltage loss. The longer the cable, the greater the voltage loss at the users end. For maximum efficiency, keep the total cable lengths between the generator set and the load equipment under 300 feet</p>
		</div>
			<div class="contentimg">
				<img src="img/sitelay.jpg"/>
			</div>
		<div class="expand-text">
			<p>If the load equipment is too sensitive to voltage loss, you may have to use shorter cables. Since having a high cable loss could cause circuits to become overloaded, the power consumed by the cable itself should always be noted and added to the total load calculations. The quantity, location, and placement of PDISE equipment are dependent upon field topology and conditions, and user needs.</p>

			<p>A typical tactical power grid consists of a power source, which is usually a generator set, that is connected to a network of PDISE. The PDISE then distributes the power through various cables and assemblages of utility extension cords and branch circuits to the electrical loads. Overloaded, the power consumed by the cable itself should always be noted and added to the total load calculations.</p>

				Load Requirements
			</div>
			<div class="expand-content">
				<div class="expand-text">
					<p>Military units deploy with a variety of equipment and vehicle types. It is important to collect all equipment load requirements. The load is the total value of power being used by all of the electrical devices that are connected to the PDISE. Computers and other electrical devices may be marked with a voltage and amperage rating, that when multiplied, provides a wattage that the device will use. The total of all of these wattage values provides the amount of power that will be needed.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="contentimg">
				<img scr="img/loadreqsold.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="expand-text">
				<p>Another means of obtaining information on unit functions is by referring to the mission and operational information found in the unit's modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) or table of distribution and allowances (TDA). Each Army unit has an MTOE or a TDA that provides general information about its mission and employment. It also contains very detailed information about its personnel and equipment numbers and types. While difficult to read and understand, these documents can provide valuable information if direct unit coordination is not possible.</p>

			<li>Single Phase Inductive Loads: P = (E x I x 0.8)/1000</li>

			<li>Three Phase Loads:
       P = (E x I x 0.8 x 1.732)/1000
       I = (Kw x 1000)/(1.732 x E x .8)</li>

			<h4>Power Distribution Plan</h4>
		</div>
				<div class="contentimg">
					<img src="img/pdp2.png"/>
				</div>
				<div class="expand-text">
					<p>Power Distribution Plan shows all of the devices being used to include the total amount of power and current required. To develop a power distribution plan you have to first understand the layout of the available power generating sources and the equipment that needs to be powered. The unit's TOE/MTOE will dictate the quantity and size of your generator sets and PDISE equipment, but various exercises may allow a selection of equipment to support the mission.</p>

					<p>Start by taking a look at any special considerations for grounding and routing of cables. You should also know general locations of the power source and the vehicles, tents, communication vans, etc. that are being provided power. Become familiar with tactical or other restrictions on locating the power sources relative to tents, shelters, and other power consuming equipment. Once this information is known, you need to understand how to determine and gather the power requirements for each load device.</p>

					<p>Phase Load Balance</p>
					<p>Phase balancing is an important step in the power distribution process. Remember, the M200, M100, and M40 PDISE systems use a three-phase input from the power source. When connecting any three phase load to these systems, the load is connected across each phase and will be automatically balanced on all phases.</p>

					<p>When connecting single-phase loads to these systems, the loads need to be placed across the phases in a balanced manner, meaning the total value of the current or amperage should be spread across the phases so that the phases have equal current values. Remember that the generator maintains voltage adjustment by monitoring phase C, so it should contain the highest load.</p>

					<p>It is crucial that each phase of the generator set is evenly loaded so that the circuits within the set are not overloaded or placed in an unstable condition. If this occurs, the safety devices within the generator set would cause it to shut down.</p>

			<div class="expand-text">
				<p>Within tent number 1 are two separate single-phase circuits that need to be placed on the output connectors of the M40 PDISE supporting that tent. One circuit has a total load of 16 amps, and the other has a total of 5 amps.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="contentimg">
				<img src="img/plbal2.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="expand-text">
				<p>Tent number 2 has four separate single-phase circuits that need to be placed on the output connectors of the M40 PDISE supporting that tent. One circuit has a total load of 2 amps, another has a total of 9 amps, another has a total of 11 amps, and the last has a total of 4 amps.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="contentimg">
				<img src="img/plbal3.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="expand-text">
				<p>A solution for connecting these loads is to place the 16 amp circuit in tent 1 on a connector of the M40 supporting tent 1 that links to phase C. Then place the remaining 5 amp circuit on phase B.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="contentimg">
				<img src="img/plbal4.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="expand-text">
				<p>Now, place the 11 amp circuit in tent 2 on a connector of that M40 which links to phase B. This now means that phases B and C have total loads of 16 amps each as seen at the generator set. Now, place the remaining circuits from tent 2 on phase A, for a total load of 15 amps.</p>
		</br>
		<p>This solution provides a balanced load across the phases of the generator set and does not overload any of the individual connector circuit breakers. There could be several solutions but the goal is to always balance the load across the phases without overloading circuits.</p>
		</div>
			<div class="contentimg">
				<img src="img/plbal5.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="expand-text">
				<p>Typically, electrical devices have labels or tags that provide power rating information. You will need to physically obtain this data from each device by locating the device and looking at its data plate or by obtaining that information from the devices technical manual..</p>
		</div>
			<div class="contentimg">
				<img src="img/manual1.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="expand-text">
				<p>The data found on the device labels can be presented in several ways. Devices such as lights, heaters, and coffee pots are known as resistive loads and will normally have power and voltage ratings. Computers and other electronic equipment may include the voltage and the current rating for the device.</p>

				<p>Note that most computers will provide a current rating over a range of voltages, usually 100-240 V. Use the maximum current draw at the 100 V rating to calculate the power required for the item.</p>

					<p>Tactical Electrical Power Equipment is the primary source for electric power in the tactical battlefield and it is a critical element in maintaining a superior military force. In order to provide the many power consuming devices with adequate power, a power distribution grid needs to be properly configured. The PDISE family of power distribution equipment provides the ability to safely and efficiently distribute power where it is needed.</p>

				<p>Generator sets are designed to operate at various voltages, frequencies, and power levels. To meet a particular power demand, an operator must choose a set with the proper characteristics. If a large set is needed but is unavailable, several small sets, each located near the load to be supplied, may be used. Additional operators and maintenance personnel may be required if several small sets replace a large one.</p>

				<p>Selecting generators that can produce the power required by a field unit is an important function. The operator or person responsible for this function must select the number and types of generators that can best meet the unit's needs. Preliminary tasks that must be completed before selecting power-generating equipment are computing the load, computing the cable size, and balancing the load required for the field unit.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="contentimg">
			<img src="img/tepe2"/>
		</div>
		<div class="expand-text">
			<p>After you have designed the distribution system and balanced the load, you can select the generating equipment to produce the power needed for the field unit. The electrical systems at most military field units supply power day and night for various lighting, heating, and power equipment.</p>

			<p>The annual load factor of a well-operated, active field unit is 50 percent or more of the capacity of the generator sets. The annual load has a power factor of 80 percent or more of the average power factor.
		The following criteria govern the generator selection process:</p>

		<li>Electrical loads to be supplied.</li>
		<li>Kilowatt rating requirements.</li>
		<li>Operating voltages required.</li>
		<li>Number of phases required.</li>
		<li>Frequency requirements</li>
		<p>Other considerations when selecting generating equipment for a field unit includeâ€”</p>
		<li>Availability of fuels.</li>
		<li>Expected life of the field unit.</li>
		<li>Availability of skilled maintenance personnel.</li>
		<li>Probable load deviation.</li>
		<p>The power and voltage requirements of the load determine the size of the generator set used. For example, a two-wire, 120-volt generator set with an output rating of 1.5 kilowatts produces enough electricity for equipment rated at 120 volts, single-phase, with a combined power load of less than 1.5 kilowatts. A 5-kilowatt, AC generator set produces enough electricity for equipment requiring between 1.5 and 4.5 kilowatts.
		Use the following guides to select a generator set:</p>

		<li>Single-phase equipment provides power for small lighting, AC and DC motors, special equipment such as radial (arc) electrical welders, and some furnace loads. You may use a two- or three-wire system, depending on the size of the load and the area serviced.</li>
		<li>Three-phase equipment provides power for almost everything except small loads. The generation and transmission lines are usually three-wire systems, but the distribution circuits may be three for four-wire. When single-phase power is obtained from three-phase circuits, operators must balance each phase at the generator set.</li>
		<li>Lighting is universally rated at 120 volts in the US. The voltage required for lighting can be obtained from a single-phase, two-wire, 120/240-volt circuit or a three-phase, four-wire, 120/208-volt circuit. Using both lighting and small-motor circuits increases the load requirements for general power applications.</li>
		<li>Small motors (less than 5 horsepower [HP]) are supplied by DC or single-phase AC systems at 120 volts. Large three-phase motors (5 HP or more) usually operate satisfactorily between 200 and 240 volts.</li>

			<p>Tactical Electrical Power Equipment is the primary source for electric power in the tactical battlefield and it is a critical element in maintaining a superior military force. In order to provide the many power consuming devices with adequate power, a power distribution grid needs to be properly configured. The PDISE family of power distribution equipment provides the ability to safely and efficiently distribute power where it is needed.</p>

			<p>The principal power distribution system for the Army is called the Power Distribution Illumination System Electrical -- or PDISE . PDISE is basically a more rugged version of home distribution boxes/panels (with various size circuits and circuit overload protection), plus the connecting cables and a utility subsystem. PDISE is designed to facilitate a safe power grid, in the past it has been difficult and power mangers had problems with improperly setting up a power grid that led to inefficient utilization of power sources, excessive power outages that caused equipment failure, safety hazards that harm users a unnecessary fuel consumption.</p>

			<p>PDISE is a family of electrical circuit boxes that safely limit the amount of power flowing from a power source to the electrical devices, also known as the load. This protects the generator set from becoming overloaded and maintains a safe working environment for the user and the load devices. PDISE also consists of the cabling and outlet boxes that are needed to develop a complete circuit of power.</p>

			<p>DISE/PDISE consists of items used to form a consolidated power network by adding components to meet specific organizational mission and requirements. DISE/PDISE provides flexibility to unit operations and can be quickly assembled or disassembled for rapid relocation. Line distance from generator to load is limited to 300 feet at maximum load, because distance greater than 300 feet would cause an unacceptable voltage loss.</p>
			<p>Each center is equipped with a master circuit breaker rated at the maximum permissible load. Each center is equipped with phase-indicator lights that indicate the presence of input power. Each center is equipped with branch circuits that are protected by isolated circuit breakers.</p>

			<p>The quantity, location, and placement of PDISE equipment are dependent upon field topology and conditions, and user needs. A typical tactical power grid consists of a power source, which is usually a generator set, that is connected to a network of PDISE. The PDISE then distributes the power through various cables and assemblages of utility extension cords and branch circuits to the electrical loads.</p>

			<p>PDISE can be thought of as a more rugged version of a typical home distribution panel that is designed to be portable and quickly assembled and disassembled, permitting rapid relocation and flexibility in configuring the power grid. PDISE equipment can be used in all weather conditions and will operate at temperatures ranging from -25Â°F to 140Â°F and at all altitudes. If special precautions are taken, PDISE equipment can operate in conditions of extreme cold or extreme heat and in environments that are extremely rainy and humid, or extremely dusty and sandy.</p>

			<p>PDISE comes in 4 sizes of distribution boxes (40, 60, 100, and 200 Amps), connecting cables, and assemblage of utility extension cords, branch circuits and lighting equipment. Supports mobility by enabling quick assemble/dissemble. Various sizes allow selection to match generator sets from 5kW to 100kW.</p>

			<p>The PDISE line of equipment consists of four individual systems that control and limit the amount of current or amps being drawn from a power source. These systems are broken into Feeder Systems, which are intended to route current to other PDISE, and Distribution Systems, which are intended to route current to the load. Note that Feeder Systems can also route current to a load, but care must be taken not to overload the system if it is also feeding current to other PDISE.</p>

			<p>Feeder Systems include the M200 PDISE and the M100 PDISE. They limit current to 200 amps and 100 amps respectively, and are a 3 phase system that requires electrical power rated at 208VAC, 50/60Hz. These systems will provide 3 phase 208VAC, 50/60Hz or single phase 120VAC, 50/60Hz electrical power depending on which output connectors are used.
			Distribution Systems include the M40 PDISE and the M60 PDISE. These limit current to 40 amps and 60 amps respectively.</p>

			<p>The M40 system is a 3 phase system that requires electrical power rated at 120/208VAC, 50/60Hz. Like the M200 and M100, it will output 3 phase 208VAC, 50/60Hz or single phase 120VAC, 50/60Hz electrical power depending on which output connectors are used. The M60 is a single phase system that requires electrical power rated at 120VAC, 50/60Hz for operating single phase 120VAC, 50/60Hz loads.</p>

			<p>The M46 Electrical Utility Assembly Kit can be used to provide lighting and 120VAC duplex receptacle outlets to field shelters. The M46 kit contains a rugged carrying case, various electrical cables for extending electrical circuits to the locations of the load devices, fluorescent lights for illumination, rugged duplex receptacles that are used for plugging in electrical loads, and various items such as ropes and hook that are used to secure these items to the inside of shelters. The provided electrical cables connect to the single-phase outputs of any PDISE system and distribute the duplex receptacles and lighting into the field shelter.</p>
