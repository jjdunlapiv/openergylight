			Survey and Develop Site Layout

				<div class="expand-text">
					<p>Identify the physical site layout and location of all tents, shelters, structures, or other equipment loads requiring electric power.</p>

					<p>Consider distances and locations from loads to power source. (cables and vehicle traffic, terrain such as water, natural or manmade obstacles) Fueling, access to fuel storage, refueling operations. (distance to fuel point, safety considerations, environmental considerations) Noise control, location of operation area. (proximity of work areas, sleep areas, DFAC/mobile kitchen [MKT]) Availability/Readiness of modified table of organization & equipment (MTOE) equipment and power requirements. Before emplacing the PDISE, the power plant must be located where the PDISE system components can reach all areas of the CB.</p>

					<div class="expand-text">
				<p>Cables used to transfer power between the generator sets, PDISE systems, and load devices are subject to voltage loss. The longer the cable, the greater the voltage loss at the users end. For maximum efficiency, keep the total cable lengths between the generator set and the load equipment under 300 feet.</p>

				<p>If the load equipment is too sensitive to voltage loss, you may have to use shorter cables. Since having a high cable loss could cause circuits to become overloaded, the power consumed by the cable itself should always be noted and added to the total load calculations. The quantity, location, and placement of PDISE equipment are dependent upon field topology and conditions, and user needs.</p>

				<p>A typical tactical power grid consists of a power source, which is usually a generator set, that is connected to a network of PDISE. The PDISE then distributes the power through various cables and assemblages of utility extension cords and branch circuits to the electrical loads. Overloaded, the power consumed by the cable itself should always be noted and added to the total load calculations.</p>
